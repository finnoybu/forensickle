<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Forensickle** is a versatile, [Python](https://www.python.org/) based digital forensics data harvesting tool designed to empower digital forensics analysts, investigators and other cybersecurity professionals in their quest for comprehensive offline analysis. With support for <!--Linux,--> macOS and Windows, this all-encompassing application combines both user-friendly graphical capabilities and robust command-line functionality, providing flexibility for users of all preferences.  With its diverse set of features and broad compatibility, Forensickle is an invaluable addition to any forensics toolkit, enabling professionals to conduct thorough investigations with ease and precision.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Forensickle works seamlessly on <!--Linux,--> macOS and Windows, ensuring investigators can utilize the tool across various operating systems.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** For those who prefer a graphical interface, Forensickle offers an intuitive GUI that simplifies the forensic analysis process, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Command-Line Efficiency:** Advanced users and experts can leverage the power of the command line to execute operations efficiently and precisely.

- **Rich Script Library:** The tool boasts an extensive collection of Python scripts tailored to collect and parse a wide range of forensics artifacts. These scripts facilitate the extraction of crucial digital evidence, simplifying the investigative process.
<!--
- **Cortex XDR/XSIAM Integration:** Forensickle extends its capabilities by natively supporting Palo Alto Networks' Cortex XDR/XSIAM. Users have the flexibility to:

  - Generate Triage Results Packages: Forensickle enables the creation of results packages for manual upload to active Cortex XDR/XSIAM instances. This ensures that investigators can seamlessly incorporate their findings into Cortex XDR/XSIAM for further analysis and action.
  
  - Register as an XDR Agent: Users can register Forensickle as an XDR agent, allowing it to transmit results packages directly to Cortex XDR. This streamlined integration enhances collaboration and real-time response, empowering investigators to take action swiftly.
